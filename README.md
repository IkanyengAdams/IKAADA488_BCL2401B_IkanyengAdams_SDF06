#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: 

I learnt about CSS advanced techniques and applied the knowledge I have to desigh this page. I honestly start to see the idea and many platforms are designed for example on my free time I go to various websites to see how buttons are created by inspecting their code.
- **Responsive Design**: 
- **Styling Elements**: 

#### Challenges Faced

The challenges I faced is when I tried to align my pictures, they didn't adjust the way I wanted them to but I went  to youtube to find a solution to my problem.

I also had a rampus with placing my buttons right only to find out that there was typos in my code and fixed them.

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**:
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: 

#### Areas for Improvement

I want to invest my time on inspecting on website regarding the layouts they used and why so that I can gain more knowledge on CSS layouts.

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: 
- **Code Optimization**: 
- **Creative Design Choices**:

#### Overall Learning Experience

I really enjoyed exploring how layouts are made and looking forward to creating my own layouts for practice and realising more features to CSS in broad!!
